#Introduction
Hive is an automotive fleet management software application.  It simulates the availability of real time vehicle intelligence for any business that operates a fleet of vehicles.  Hiveâ€™s real time data includes vehicle location, incident notification, and vehicle activity.  In addition to real-time data, Hive also provides dashboards which track metrics such as vehicle breakdowns, vehicle miles traveled, and other vehicle activities.

The dataset includes data for approximately 500 taxicabs and includes 30 days of location data.
